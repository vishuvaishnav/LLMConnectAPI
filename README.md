# LLMConnectAPI
LLMConnectAPI is a FastAPI project that provides secure access to a local LLM (like Mistral via Ollama) using API keys with credit limits. Each request consumes a credit and returns an AI-generated response. It's lightweight, easy to use, and includes a test client for quick integration and testing.
